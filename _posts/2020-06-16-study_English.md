Since last week, I've participated in English study group to increase my verbal skill. 
We talked each other with topics that members want to share.
I selected current situation of Cov-19 in US as topic 
last week. It was interesting but at the same time it was too specific. Unless you catch up with what happens in US, 
it was hard to tell. That's why I expected today's title. 

MBTI stands for Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) which is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.
Based on this test, we could talk each other for themselves. It wasn't easy to tell someone's story to others. 
Even in Korea, It is awkward in some aspects. On top of that, It looks hard to understand the background why they've had those characteristics.
Regardless of these facts, It was fun experience for us to tell ourselves.
