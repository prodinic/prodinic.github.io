Since March this year, I've worked for Mathpresso as software engineer intern in Korea. As I left only 2 weeks,
I wanted to end up with some articles about experiences in this company. This company gave me good memories and 
nice friends. What I'm going to share is what kind of works this company do and people in Mathpresso.


* Who is Mathpresso?

Mathpresso is leading edu-tech company in Korea running their own education platform called 'Qanda' standing for 'Question 
AND Answer'. All problems enrolled from students are dealt with by Top-level college teachers giving a snapshot of 
solutions. The coverage is spreading out not only Math but Science and English. At the same time, 
Using AI and big data, they suggest personalized and customized contents to users and 
achieve to be a best contents provider in education market in Korea. This ambitious company seeks to be Google
and Youtube in education field over the world.

* Young and outstanding people

What I've impressed for this company is that smart people are all around the office. Most of programmers had 
good algorithm background. Surprisingly, a few of rankers of BOJ which is one of the biggest problem solving websites in Korea 
were working. Not only these guys, but other good programmers were same team. On top of that, as Mathpresso achieve global
company, there are global teammates in the office too. All the meeting and team-chat apps has been translated into various
languages simultaneously.

* Teamwork and culture

Every team has their own cultures. However, I pretty sure that our team is one of teams which have awesome cultures and 
teamwork. We could work remotely once a week. However, code is managed strictly. Code review is required and
It is hard to get accepted at once. We had scrum meeting everyday. We share what we did and what we are going to
do today and challenges. Sometimes, it is tough but challenging.
