What I want to do is to share story how I could nonstop run 10km. As soon as I came back to Korea,
I started to work from small startup. Back then, I was so passionate that I worked really hard.
All I had done was work and read. However, since I didn't workout at all, this bad habit ruined
my body. On top of that, back pain was so hurt that I couldn't do anything in front of computer.
Even I couldn't sit at all. 

I didn't want to be miserable. I decided to go to gym. I stepped onto the treadmill and started to
run. My first record was really bad. Since I want to be better, I shared this story with my friends.
One of my friends told me how ninja train himself. Ninja jump as high as bamboo. The more bamboo
grows, the more ninja can jump every single day. I applied this lesson to my training.

I increased my running time 1 minutes longer than I got yesterday. During 2 months, I kept running and 
finally I could run 53 minutes which is 10km. After I achieve my goal, I felt my body was changed. 
My body strength became strong and I could be more positive which makes me come about with new ways of
thinking and confidence.

I looked up why I felt like that. As a matter of fact, a couple of studies came out recently that
running controls attention and avoid distraction. And I want to illustrate one of key areas in your
brain which is located in temporal lobe. You have two temporal lobes in your brain right and left. 
Deep in the temporal lobe is key structure critical for your ability to retain and form long-term
memory for facts and events. That structure is called Hippocampus.

Thus, if you need change, running might be your choice!
